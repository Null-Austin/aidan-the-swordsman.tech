## How to...
 - How to create a page
   - To creat a HTML page, first click the plus icon in the top right of the "repo"
   - Then set your page title to whatever u want `url.com/smth` (such as `smth`) to be at, while adding `.html` to the end of it
   - you should now have smth like `smth.html`! Now you paste in your code to the content, and save it
